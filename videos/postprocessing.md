title: Postprocessing simulation results using ParaView
---

In this series, we talk about how to use ParaView efficiently to post-process the results of computational simulations.

## Series Materials

In order to follow the videos and reproduce the output, you need the raw simulations results. You can download these files (separately for each project) from [this shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1emHuLLkXBkJoCii_4obBy9PNRlK7n1Vq?usp=sharing).
