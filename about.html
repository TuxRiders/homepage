<p> TuxRiders, a journey to open-source scientific computing and computational engineering.
</p>

<p>
    In TuxRiders aims to demonstrate the power of open-source scientific computing for real-world scientific research. 
    In addition to this, we want to cover the underlying mathematics and computer science-related concepts to help you 
    efficiently employ the discussed methods and techniques in mathematical and computational modeling projects.
