<p> TuxRiders, a journey to open-source scientific computing and computational engineering.
</p>

<p>
    In TuxRiders aims to demonstrate the power of open-source scientific computing for real-world scientific research. 
    In addition to this, we want to cover the underlying mathematics and computer science-related concepts to help you 
    efficiently employ the discussed methods and techniques in mathematical and computational modeling projects. This will be achieved 
    by various video series featuring different aspects of validated research projects in the field of computational science. 
    These research works are (getting) published in the relevant scientific journals.
</p>

<p>
    Materials provided by TuxRiders project will stand somewhere between the traditional instructive tutorials and general demos of features. 
     In this way, we want the audiences, despite the variety of background they might have, to benefit from the published content to 
     increase their knowledge of scientific computing while getting to know the possibilities provided by the powerful world of open-source software development.
